Zimbabwe,Mining,ZWE,"Zimbabwe's gold mining sector scores 29 of 100 points and ranks 81st of 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Its failing performance is driven by an enabling environment that is characterized by failing institutions. Zimbabwe's gold mining sector contributes 23 percent to the country's total exportsand its gold reserves total nearly seven million ounces.
"
Zambia,Mining,ZMB," Zambia's copper mining sector scores 50 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 40th among 89 index assessments and 11th within the sub-Saharan Africa region. This overall weak score is particularly impacted by poor revenue management. As a middle-income country with 16 million inhabitants, Zambia has a gross domestic product per capita of just above USD 100. Mining constitutes 78 percent of Zambia's total exports making it one of the most resource-dependent member countries of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The mining sector contributes one fifth of government revenues and in the absence of significant diversification, its governance is likely to remain of strategic importance to Zambia.
"
Yemen,Oil and Gas,YEM,"Yemen's oil and gas sector scores 30 of 100 points and ranks 78th of 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Yemen's poor performance can be attributed to a failing enabling environment created by an armed conflict that has split the country into two separately controlled areas and left the population on the brink of famine. Yemen is hobbled by political instability, government ineffectiveness and corruption. Yemen's modest oil production is also impacted by the conflict, though oil and gas constitute a fraction of the country's total exports. The straits off the Yemeni coast are important trade routes for oil from neighboring countries, and the conflict may impact regional oil trade by destabilizing these routes.
"
Vietnam,Oil and Gas,VNM,"Vietnam's largely state-controlled oil and gas sector scores 48 of 100 points and ranks 45th of 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). This result is driven by weak performance in the enabling environment component. The country has oil reserves of four billion barrelsand gas reserves of 25 trillion cubic feet, which combined constitutes 6 percent of Vietnam's exports.
"
Venezuela,Oil and Gas,VEN,"Venezuela's oil and gas sector scores 33 of 100 points and ranks 74th of 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). This poor performance is driven by its failing enabling environment where Venezuela ranks 80th with a score of 17. Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves&mdash;300 billion barrels of oiland 200 trillion cubic feet of gas &mdash;and the oil and gas sector constitutes 98 percent of total exports. As the most resource-dependent country in the Latin American and Caribbean region, the poor governance of the natural resource sector has dire impacts on Venezuela's economic development and political stability.
"
Uzbekistan,Oil and Gas,UZB,"Uzbekistan's oil and gas sector scores 29 of 100 points and ranks 80th of 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). The country's enabling environment accounts for its failing scores in the index. Uzbekistan has reserves of just below 600 million barrels of oiland gas reserves totaling to 65 trillion cubic feet. There is little data available on the sector's share of total exports, economic activity or government revenues.
"
United States of America (Gulf of Mexico),Oil and Gas,USA,"The United States of America's (US) oil and gas sector scores 74 of 100 in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking fifth among 89 assessments. This assessment focuses on the Gulf of Mexico, the US's main oil producing area. The US as a whole produces 16percent of the world's oil, and following a shale gas revolution, over 20 percent of the world's natural gas. As home to some of the world's largest oil companies, the impacts of resource governance in the US reverberate well beyond the operations taking place on or off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The US has led the way in setting a better standard of resource governance in some instances; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is cited as having significantly improved how US-headquartered extraction companies operate around the world. Furthermore, section 1504 of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act promised to increase transparency of company-government financial relations.Its implementation has been subject to major delays which has been aggravated by the recent disapproval of the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) implementing rule in early 2017.
"
United Kingdom,Oil and Gas,UK,"The United Kingdom's (UK) oil and gas sector scores 77 of 100 in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking third among 89 index assessments. This result can be attributed to the UK's good enabling environment, which scores 95 of 100 and ranks fourth in the index. The UK has proven oil reserves of 200 million barrelsand gas reserves of 7 trillion cubic feet. The oil and gas sector constitutes eight percent of the UK's exports. Many global oil companies are headquartered in London and the UK government's recent progress in mandatory disclosure requirements has the potential to positively impact transparency on payments by oil companies to governments around the world. Compared to the 55 oil and gas sector assesments in the index, the UK is second only to Norway's in the index. It could improve by disclosing details of licensing, ownership and environmental documentation.
"
United Arab Emirates,Oil and Gas,UAE,"The oil and gas sector in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) scores 42 of 100 points and ranks 54th of 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Its poor overall performance is driven by a failing score in revenue management (16 of 100). The UAE is currently the eight-largest petroleum producer in the world; over 90 percent of its proven reserves (98 billion barrels of oil and 215 trillion cubic feet of gas) are in Abu Dhabi. Each emirate controls the oil resources in its territory and sets the laws and policies for its oil and gas sector development. In Abu Dhabi, the Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) sets Abu Dhabi's petroleum policies and the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) runs the day-to-day operations. The sector constitutes 43 percent of the country's exports.
"
Ukraine,Oil and Gas,UKR,"Ukraine's oil and gas sector scores a weak 49 of 100 and ranks 44th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Satisfactory performance in value realization is offset by poor performance in revenue management. Ukraine&#39;s hydrocarbon reserves amount to 395 million barrels of oil and 39 trillion cubic feet of gas. In 2014, Ukraine ranked fourth in Europe by volume of gas produced. Nevertheless, it is a net importer of natural gas and has historically been dependent on Russian gas. The annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 and the resulting tension between the two countries prompted Ukraine to diversify its gas sources. Following a 2015 government decree, the state-owned enterprise (SOE), Naftogaz, is required to sell its production to domestic refineries and is only allowed to export the surplus.
"
Uganda,Oil and Gas,UGA,"Uganda's oil and gas sector scores 44 of 100 in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), placing it 51st among 89 assessments in the index. This result is worsened by governance gaps in the extractive sector components and improved slightly by the enabling environment. Uganda has proven oil reserves of under two billion barrels, which attracted interest in exploration during the commodity boom of the last decade. However, early years of exploitation have been marked by uncertainties related to investment conditions andinfrastructure development with neighboring countries, and resistance by local communities. Reforms are under way, aiming to address the poor or failing performance of the oil and gas sector's licensing regime, state-owned enterprise (SOE) and revenue management, so that Uganda can create better governance conditions before it begins larger scale oil production.
"
Turkmenistan,Oil and Gas,TKM,"Turkmenistan's oil and gas sector scores 11 of 100 points and ranks 88th of 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). This failing performance is driven by the country's bottom-ranking score (89 out of 89 assessments) in the area of revenue management. Little information about Turkmenistan's resource sector governance is available. It is heavily resource dependent, and oil rents (which constitute 19 percent of the country's gross domestic product) are distributed unequally across the country's five million people. Its oil reserves amount to 600 million barrels and gas reserves total 265 trillion cubic feet.
"
Tunisia,Oil and Gas,TUN,"Tunisia's oil and gas sector scores 56 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index, making it the best performer in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and 26th among 89 assessments in the overall ranking. Tunisia has total natural gas reserves of two trillion cubic feet1and is not a major global hydrocarbons producer. According to the World Bank, hydrocarbons constituted seven percent of Tunisia's total exports in 2015.Since the Tunisian revolution, governance of the oil, gas and mining sectors has featured prominently in national reform discussions and the rewriting of the constitution, which now names the Tunisian people as owners all resources. Translating constitutional provisions into specific transparency requirements of the hydrocarbons code remains a work in progress.
"
Tunisia,Mining,TUN,"Tunisia is one of the world's top-ten phosphate producers and home to the world's fifth largest phosphate producing company, the state-owned Compagnie de Phosphate de Gafsa (CPG). Tunisia's mining sector scores 46 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index, placing it 48th among 89 assessments in the overall ranking. Despite the overall weak performance, Tunisia's mining sector ranks fifth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The phosphate mining industry is prone to environmental challenges and this is reflected in Tunisia's weak performance in terms of local impacts. Since the 2011 Tunisian revolution, governance of the oil, gas and mining sectors has featured prominently in discussions about reform in the country. Of the index's &ldquo;dual sector&rdquo; countries&mdash;those whose mining and oil and gas sectors were both assessed&mdash;Tunisia has the largest difference in performance between the two sectors &ndash; 10 points and 22ranks, pointing to potential for improvement in the mining sector.
"
Trinidad and Tobago,Oil and Gas,TTO,"Trinidad and Tobago scores 64 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 14th among 89 assessments in the index. This broadly positive result is driven by satisfactory scores in the enabling environment and value realization components, whereas it achieves a weak score in the revenue management component. The country has vast natural gas reserves, standing at 11 trillion cubic feet. Even though oil and gas-based products constituted over half of Trinidad and Tobago's exports in 2015, the small country has emerged as an example of success in investing oil and gas revenues to diversify the economy.
"
Timor-Leste,Oil and Gas,TLS,"Timor-Leste's oil and gas sector scores 49 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 43rd among 89 assessments and eighth among 15 assessments in the Asia Pacific region. This overall score is lowered by a poor score in the enabling environment component. Even though both extractive sector components, value realization and revenue management, achieve similar scores, there is great variation in performance at the subcomponent level. The oil and gas sector constituted 98 percent of exports and 97 percent of government revenues in 2013, making this sector a key facilitator of economic development.
"
Tanzania,Oil and Gas,TZA,"Tanzania's oil and gas sector scores 53 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). In contrast to its mature mining industry, Tanzania has not yet started large-scale production of gas following the discovery of significant offshore gas deposits &ndash; currently estimated at 57 trillion cubic feet. Tanzania's satisfactory performance in value realization, the component that measures the quality of governance in licensing, taxation, local impacts and state participation, is largely based on a legal framework that contains several important provisions on governance and transparency. As the country is not yet producing or exporting from most of these major gas fields, the relevant laws remain largely untested. Depending on progress with investment and implementation, the oil and gas industry has the potential to deliver significant benefits to one of the world's fastest growing populations.
"
Tanzania,Mining,TZA,"Tanzania's mining sector scores 49 of 100 points and ranks 42nd among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Tanzania is Africa's fourth-largest gold producer; this assessment focuses on gold mining, based on data collected during 2016. Tanzania has a mature mining industry. In the 2013&ndash;14 fiscal year revenues from gold mining constituted 80 percent of the extractive industries' 12 percent contribution to Tanzanian government revenues. Concerns over equitable distribution of benefits between investors, the government and local communities haveled the Tanzanian government to take steps towards improving governance and transparency. Some of these measures, such as improved access to sector data, are captured by this assessment. Others, such as renegotiation of contracts, are not. The results point to a need to close the gap between legal requirements and enforcement across severalareas, and more specifically, to address shortcomings in licensing and state-owned enterprise (SOE) governance.
"
Sudan,Oil and Gas,SDN,"Sudan's oil and gas sector scores 21 of 100 points and ranks 86th of 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). The country's enabling environment scores just 11 of 100 points and is a major factor in the country's overall performance in the index. Sudan is highly dependent on natural resources. It has has oil reserves of five billion barrels, and the oil and gas sector contributes 91 percent to the country's total exports.
"
South Sudan,Oil and Gas,SSD,"South Sudan's oil and gas sector scores 32 of 100 points and ranks 76th of 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Thepoor performance of the world's youngest country is mainly attributable to a failing enabling environment characterized by conflict and abuses that are driven in part by fighting over the control of oil resources. The Petroleum Act of 2012 set a satisfactory baseline for oil sector governance, but it has largely gone unenforced due to conflict.
"
South Africa,Mining,ZAF,"South Africa's gold mining sector scores 57 of 100 points and ranks 23rd of 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Sub-Saharan Africa's largest gold producer, South Africa, scores well in enabling environment, characterized by high government effectiveness, voice and accountability. However, it has the highest gini coefficient in the region; in the context of reforming the country's Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act and Mining Charter, there has been debate around the equitable distribution of benefits from the mining sector to the 55 million South Africans. South Africa boasts the most diversified economy in sub-Saharan Africa, but the mining sector still contributes 24 percent to total exports and is a major earner of government revenues. South Africa has gold reserves of just under 146 million ounces and also has world-class deposits of platinum, manganese and diamonds.
"
Sierra Leone,Mining,SLE,"Sierra Leone's iron ore sector scores 46 of 100 points and ranks 49th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Despite its weak overall performance, the country performs satisfactorily in the index's value realization component, where it ranks 18th. Though the mining sector contributed only one percent to total exports in 2015,Sierra Leone's extractive sector rents account for 24 percent of gross domestic product, making Sierra Leone among the most resource-dependent of Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative countries.
"
Saudi Arabia,Oil and Gas,SAU,"Saudi Arabia's oil and gas sector scores 36 of 100 points and ranks 69th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Saudi Arabia's poor overall performance in the index is largely attributable to scores in the value realization (which reflects licensing, taxation, local impact and the governance of state-owned enterprises) and revenue management components. The country scores 23 and 24 of 100 points for these components respectively. Though Saudi Arabia has developed significant skill and experience managing the oil and gas sector, the RGI assessment reveals governance challenges that weaken accountability to citizens and could hinder achievement of Saudi Arabia's long-term goals.

Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter. In 2015 it launched Vision 2030, a diversification strategy that involves preparing its national oil company, Saudi Aramco, for an initial public offering of shares. The goal of Vision 2030 is to finance investing in non-oil sectors such as public infrastructure and technology ventures. The success of this initiative will depend heavily on the ultimate valuation of the company. However, Saudi Aramco's governance receives a failing score in the index. For now, Saudi Arabia remains one of the world's most oil-dependent economies, with the sector contributing 78 percent of exports.
"
Russia,Oil and Gas,RUS,"Russia's oil and gas sector scores 45 of 100 points and ranks 50th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Russia's has proven oil reserves of 80 billion barrelsand its gas reserves constitute just under 100 trillion cubic feet;in total, the sector constitues 63 percent of total exports.The global drop in oil prices, economic sanctions and increased military spending have caused currency and financial challenges in recent years.
"
Qatar,Oil and Gas,QAT,"Qatar's oil and gas sector scores a poor 43 of 100 points and ranks 53rd of 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Despite boasting the highest per capita gross domestic product in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and a strong enabling environment, Qatar's oil and gas governance receives low scores in several caterories, including revenue management, licensing and tax transparency. With proven oil reserves of over 25 billion barrelsand gas reserves totaling 858 trillion cubic feet, Qatar's oil and gas sector contributes 83 percent to exports.
"
Philippines,Mining,PHL,"The Philippines, a middle-income country with a population of over 100 million, scores 58 of 100 in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 21st among 89 assessments and fifth among 15 assessments in the Asia Pacific region. Satisfactory performance in enabling environment is offset by weak performance in value realization and revenue management. However, timely publication of financial reports and additional disclosures, including the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) reports, have led to improvements in the transparency of the Philippine Mineral Development Corporation. The mining sector contributes 4 percent to the Philippines&#39;s exports and with 6000 metric tons of nickel produced in 2016, the Philippines is among the top ten global producers of nickel; this assessment therefore focuses on nickel.
"
Peru,Mining,PER,"Peru scores a satisfactory 62 of 100 in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI) and ranks 16th among 89 assessments. Peru achieves its best score in value realization, scoring 68 of 100, and worst in revenue management, scoring 57 of 100. Peru has the second-largest copper reserves in the world after neighboring Chile, with an estimated 90 million metric tons in 2016. Additionally, Peru has significant oil, gas, silver, zinc and lead reserves, all of which contribute to the prominence of extractive industries in Peruvian public policy. In the run-up to the 2018 local elections, debates on diversification and decentralization of extractive sector management have gained importance. Based on the index results, the Peruvian government should strengthen audit and oversight mechanisms, governance at the subnational level and environmental compliance.
"
Papua New Guinea,Mining,PNG,"Papua New Guinea's copper mining sector scores a weak 47 of 100 points and ranks 46th of 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). With minerals constituting 55 percent of total exports, Papua New Guinea has one of the least diversified economies in the Asia-Pacific region. It is also the most resource-dependent country in the region and among Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative countries. Extractive sector rents constitute 24 percent of Papua New Guinea's gross domestic product
"
Oman,Oil and Gas,OMN,"Oman's oil and gas sector scores 50 of 100 points and ranks 39th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). The sectors' overall performance is driven by a good enabling environment, scoring 76 of 100 points and ranking 12th in the index in this area. The country has five billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 23 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves.The sector constitutes 62 percent of the country's total exports and extractive sector rents constitute 23 percent of gross domestic product.
"
Norway,Oil and Gas,NOR,"Norway's oil and gas sector scores 86 of 100 points and ranks first among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Its good performance is driven by a high score of 97 of 100 in the enabling environment component. With the highest gross domestic product per capita but also the highest resource dependence among countries assessed in the index in Western Europe and North America, Norway has reaped the benefits of sound resource governance. Its oil and gas sector contributes 58 percent to exports,1its oil reserves contain just above 500 million barrels2and its gas reserves total 66 trillion cubic feet.3Recent governance debates center around diversifying the non-oil sector and the role of the Government Pension Fund Global (the world's largest sovereign wealth fund) in investing in other industries.
"
Nigeria,Oil and Gas,NGA,"Nigeria scores 42 of 100 points and ranks 55th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). It has the largest oil and gas reserves in sub-Saharan Africa with an estimated 37 billion barrels of oil and 188 trillion cubic feet of gas. Nigeria is one of the world's most resource-dependent countries &mdash; oil and gas contributed the majority of government revenues and constituted 90 percent of Nigeria's exports in 2015. Nigeria also has the largest population on the African continent, so the oil and gas sector's governance issues impact the wellbeing of a large number of people. Governance challenges are present throughout the extractive decision chain. Value is lost particularly in licensing and in the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation's (NNPC) sales of government oil, as well as when revenues from oil and gas are shared and saved. Furthermore, a history of scandals involving top officials and the NNPC has plagued the sector and drawn public attention to corruption and asset recovery. Given NNPC's central role in all stages of the decision chain, improving governance of the state-owned enterprise (SOE) is crucial.
"
Niger,Mining,NER,"Niger's uranium mining sector scores 54 of 100 points and ranks 31st among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). A low-income country with 20 million inhabitants, Niger has the lowest gross domestic product per capita in the sub-Saharan Africa region. Nevertheless, Niger's mining sector is the eighth best governed natural resource sector in the region. The country's uranium reserves are estimated at over 30000 metric tons and uranium constitutes over 50 percent of the country's exports.
"
Myanmar,Oil and Gas,MMR,"Myanmar's oil and gas sector scores 31 of 100 points and ranks 77th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Compared to the country's gemstones sector, progress in transparency is more visible in the oil and gas sector, which is emerging as a significant contributor of revenue to the state's coffers. According to the first Myanmar Extractive IndustriesTransparency Initiative (EITI) report, the oil and gas sector contributed 85 percent of reported revenues from the extractive sector, generating nearly a quarter of the government's revenues. Some reforms to the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are underway. A failing enabling environment reflects the persistent challenges faced by a country that has suffered decades of internal conflict.Myanmar's enabling environment is assessed as failing.
"
Myanmar,Mining,MMR,"Myanmar's gemstone sector scores 27 of 100 points and ranks 83rd among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). This assessment focuses solely on Myanmar's gemstone sector, which is governed by a separate legal framework from other minerals. The gemstone sector remains opaque, with a lack of public access to rules on licensing or the fiscal regime. Myanmar is one of the poorest countries in the world when measured by gross domestic product per capita. The country has suffered decades of internal conflict, partly financed by jade mining. Although significant variation exists between valuations, Myanmar's annual rough jade production is generally estimated to be worth billions of dollars. Improved transparency around the entire sector, particularly in licensing, ownership, production and revenue data, would be a step towards better governance.
"
Mozambique,Oil and Gas,MOZ,"Mozambique scores 50 of 100 in the 2017 Resource Governance Index placing it at the 41st position among 89 assessments in the index. Within sub-Saharan Africa Mozambique ranks 12th among 31 assessments. Performance is brought up by value realization, and down by revenue management and enabling environment. As a low-income country populated by 28 million people, Mozambique's discovery of gas reserves of 100 trillion cubic feet have created excitement over the potential economic benefits from these resources. In 2014, extractive resources contributed 30 percent to total exports of which eight percent were exports of natural gas to South Africa. They made up 21percent of Mozambique's budget revenues.
"
Morocco,Mining,MAR,"Morocco's phosphate mining sector scores 52 of 100 points and ranks 37th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). This score is boosted by a satisfactory enabling environment, with limited corruption and strong rule of law, but hampered by poor revenue management. Morocco is home to three quarters of global phosphate reserves, with an estimated 50 billion metric tons. The state-owned mining company, OCP, controls all phosphate mining activities in the country.
"
Mongolia,Mining,MNG,"Mongolia's mining sector scores a satisfactory 64 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), placing it 15th among 89 assessments and first among nine countries assessed in the Eurasia region. By population, Mongolia is the smallest country in Eurasia, with three million citizens. It has 18 million metric tons of copper reserves, representing two percent of global reserves. These copper reserves have attracted considerable investment over the past decade. According to 2015 Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) data, resource revenues represented 24 percent of government revenues. Mongolia has developed a number of policies to manage resource revenues, including the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund and distribution of revenues via direct cash transfers, however, the recent fall of commodity prices has pushed the country in to a debt crisis. This is reflected in a weak score for revenue management, in contrast with satisfactory scores in other components of resource governance.
"
Mexico,Oil and Gas,MEX,"To improve the competitiveness of its oil and gas sector, Mexico launched energy reforms in 2013 that restructured state agencies and opened the sector to private investment. Following these reforms, Mexico's oil and gas sector scores 61 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index, performing satisfactorily in value extraction and enabling environment, but weakly on revenue management. Mexico has the world's 16th-largest oil reserves, with just under 10 billion barrels of oil. In addition, Mexico has gas reserves estimated at 13 trillion cubic feet. Depletion of historical oil blocks along with public investment constraints have led to a significant reduction in government revenues from the petroleum sector, from 34 percent in 2009 to 21 percent in 2016. Oil and gas have fallen to six percent of total exports and energy imports have increased.
"
Mexico,Mining,MEX,"Mexico's mining sector scores 60 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI) and ranks 19th among 89 assessments. Its overall performance is brought down by weak revenue management, particularly in subnational resource revenue sharing. Mexico is the world's seventh-largest gold producer and produced four million ounces of gold in 2016. Gold constitutes one percent of Mexico's total exportsand the wider mining sector, which also includes significant silver production, constitutes three percent.This assessment focuses on gold mining, an industry which has seen significant growth in investment and output over the past ten years. Yet in 2015, it contributed less than one percentof government revenues. 
"
Mauritania,Mining,MRT,"Mauritania's iron ore mining sector scores 29 of 100 points and ranks 82nd among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Its overall failing performance is impacted by a score of 10 of 100 points in the revenue management subcomponent, ranking 87thin the index. With four million inhabitants and a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of USD 100, Mauritania can be classified as a middle-income country with the lowest GDP in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. It has just over one billion metric tons of proven iron ore reserves, representing almost one percent of global reserves. The mining sector constitutes just under 60 percent of the country's total exports and extractive sector rents constitute 32 percent of GDP. This places Mauritania among the most resource dependent Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) countries.
"
Mali,Mining,MLI,"Mali's gold mining sector scores 53 of 100 points and ranks 35th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Its overall performance is boosted by satisfactory performance in the revenue management component, ranking eighth in the index. Mali is classified as a low-income country and has endured a decade of political instability. Gold constitutes 29 percent of the country's total exports and other minerals account for an additional four percent of exports. Mali has just over 20 million ounces of proven gold reserves, placing it among the top 20 global gold producers.
"
Malaysia,Oil and Gas,MYS,"Malaysia scores 56 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 27th among 89 assessments. Malaysia has managed to invest petroleum revenues to diversify the economy, but recent challenges with high-level corruption and rising criticism over sharing of petroleum revenues are challenging the perception of good governance of the country's oil and gas sector. The country has proven oil reserves of just under 300 million barrels and gas reserves of 40 trillion cubic feet. The oil and gas sector constitutes 16 percent of Malaysia's total exports.
"
Madagascar,Mining,MDG,"Madagascar's nickel mining sector scores 36 of 100 points and ranks 68th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). This overall poor performance is impacted by the sectors poor score of 34 of 100 in revenue management. Madagascar is a low-income country with a population of 24 million, it has a gross domestic product of USD 400 per capita. The mining sector constitutes 35 percent of its total exports and with nickel reserves standing at 1 million tons, Madagascar has the potential to continue growing its mining sector. The government could alleviate opposition to environmental impacts and concerns over equitable sharing of benefits by closing the gap between the mining legal framework and its implementation, particularly in regard to local impact and subnational revenue sharing.
"
Libya,Oil and Gas,LBY,"Libya's oil and gas sector scores 18 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 87th among 89 assessments in the index and last among 16 countries assessed in the Middle East and North Africa region. Libya is one of the most oil-dependent countries in the world. Oil constituted nearly all of its exportsbefore the conflict that followed the end of former President Muammar Gaddafi's regime. Libya's oil production has suffered significantly as a result of the conflict. Failing governance can be attributed to the enabling environment; Libya also ranks in the bottom five in several critical policy areas. As Libyans struggle to rebuild their economy, reform of vital institutions for the management of oil and gas revenues &mdash; the Libyan Investment Authority and the National Oil Company &mdash; is key to stability.
"
Liberia,Mining,LBR,"Liberia's iron ore mining sector scores 44 of 100 points and ranks 52nd among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). The sector's overall performance is lowered by a score of 30 of 100 in revenue management.

"
Kyrgyzstan,Mining,KGZ,"The Kyrgyz Republic&#39;s scores 51 of 100 in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Natural resources form a significant part of the Kyrgyz Republic's economy; the country has 20 million ounces of gold reserves representing one percent of global reserves. The government of the Kyrgyz Republic has been undertaking reforms towards greater transparency in mineral resource governance and public financial management, which boost index performance in licensing, taxation and revenue sharing. However, local impact and state-owned enterprise (SOE) governance lag behind. The Kyrgyz Republic's index score is lowered by the enabling environment, particularly rule of law and control of corruption.
"
Kuwait,Oil and Gas,KWT,"Kuwait's oil and gas sector scores 54 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 33rd among 89 assessments. Its weak performance is improved by a satisfactory enabling environment but constrained by value realization, the component measuring governance of licensing, taxation, local impact and state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The country has proven oil reserves of 100 billion barrelsand gas reserves of 64 trillion cubic feet.Kuwait's four million inhabitants have a gross domestic product per capita of almost USD 3000, largely a result of the country's considerable oil wealth. The oil and gas sector constitutes just under 90 percent of Kuwait's total exports. The sector is controlled by SOEs, which contract private companies for services and materials only.
"
Kazakhstan,Oil and Gas,KAZ,"Kazakhstan scores 56 of 100 points and ranks 25th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Kazakhstan has the highest gross domestic product per capita in the Eurasia region. With 30 billion barrelsof proven oil reserves and 85 trillion cubic feetof gas reserves, Kazakhstan is among the world's top 15 global gas producers. The oil and gas sector constitutes 68 percent of the country's exports,placing Kazakhstan among the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative's (EITI) most resource-dependent countries. To date, Kazakhstan's population of 17 million people has not benefited equally from these resources; the population is among the worlds poorest according to the Multidimensional Poverty Index, which assesses economic and non-economic measures of poverty at the individual level.
"
Iraq,Oil and Gas,IRQ,"Iraq's oil and gas sector scores 38 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 61st among 89 assessments. A middle-income country with a population of 36 million, Iraq has one of the world's largest oil and gas reserves.It is one of the world's largest oil producers and oil is reported to constitute close to 100 percent of its exports.Despite the slump in oil prices and a conflict, which has been exacerbated in recent years, Iraq's oil production has grown steadily. Following a period of reform, its state-owned enterprise (SOE) scores 66 of 100 and ranks 18th among 74 SOEs assessed in the index &mdash; a highlight amidst generally poor governance.
"
Iran,Oil and Gas,IRN,"Iran's oil and gas sector scores 38 of 100 points and ranks 62nd of 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Iran has proven oil reserves totalling just under 160 billion barrelsand gas reserves comprising nearly 100 trillion cubic feet.The recent lifting of sanctions against Iran creates an opportunity to attract investment and further develop the country's oil and gas resources. Renewed growth in a sector that was off limits to international oil companies for a period could provide an important opportunity and test for the governance of the sector.
"
Indonesia,Oil and Gas,IDN,"Indonesia's oil and gas sector scores a satisfactory 68 of 100 and ranks 12th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). As in the mining sector, Indonesia's oil and gas sector is better governed in revenue management than in value realization, achieving its highest score of 76 of 100 for revenue management. As the third-most populous country in Asia, Indonesia has a large domestic market for energy and other oil-based products, which has facilitated downstream development of the mature oil and gas industry. Indonesia's oil production makes up one percent of global oil output. In 2015, fuel exports constituted over 20 percent of the country's total exports.
"
Indonesia,Mining,IDN,"Indonesia's mining sector scores a satisfactory 68 of 100 in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 11th among 89 assessments.Indonesia's mining and oil and gas sectors perform well in revenue management, both scoring a satisfactory 76 of 100, whereas mining sector resource governance is weakened by problems in value realization and enabling environment. Low commodity prices, a slowdown in global demand and mineral depletion have put pressure on Indonesia's coal-dominated mining industry. This assessment focuses on copper; Indonesia has the world's eighth-largest copper reserves with 25 million metric tons and in 2016, it contributed four percent of global copper production. Copper constituted eight percent of its exports in 2016.
"
India,Oil and Gas,IND,"India's oil and gas sector scores 70 of 100 points and ranks 9th of 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). It has proven oil reserves of 549 million barrelsand gas reserves of 43 trillion cubic feetThe oil and gas sector contributes 12 percent of total exports,but growing domestic demand makes India a net oil importer. In 2015, India was the fourth largest consumer of oil after the United States, China and Japan.
"
Guinea,Mining,GIN,"Guinea's mining sector scores 38 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 63rd among 89 assessments and 20th among 31 assessments in sub-Saharan Africa. Failing revenue management contributes to its overall poor performance, with a score of 24of 100 and rank of 78th place. Guinea is a low-income country with a population of 13 million and gross domestic product per capita of USD 500. The country has the world's largest bauxite reservesand is the third-largest bauxite producer and exporter in the world. This assessment, therefore, focuses on bauxite because of its importance to Guinea's economy, although Guinea also produces gold and diamonds and has significant reserves of iron ore. Mining represented over 60 percent of Guinea's total exports and 24 percent of total government revenues in 2015.
"
Guatemala,Mining,GTM,"Guatemala's gold mining sector scores 41 of 100 points and ranks 56th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Its overall score is lowered by poor revenue management, scoring 35 of 100 in that component. Guatemala is a middle-income country with 16 million inhabitants, it has just under 50000 ounces of gold reserves and the mining sector constitutes seven percent of the country's total exports.
"
Ghana,Oil and Gas,GHA,"Ghana's oil and gas sector scores a satisfactory 67 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), making it the best performer in sub-Saharan Africa. Ghana has a favorable enabling environment and also performs well in revenue management. Its sovereign wealth fund is the second-best governed among 34 funds assessed in the index. Furthermore, Ghana's Petroleum Revenue Management Act allocates oil revenues transparently between the budget, the national oil company and two funds. Yet, Ghana has accumulated a large budget deficit and borrowed heavily against future oil revenues, even though oil revenues presently constitute only four percent of total government revenues. Ghana's rules for managing petroleum revenues are disconnected from those governing broader public finances.
"
Ghana,Mining,GHA,"Ghana's mining sector scores 56 of 100 points and ranks 24th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). The sector performs better than most others in sub-Saharan Africa, mainly because of a satisfactory enabling environment, however, performance in revenue management is poor. This assessment focuses on gold mining; gold accounts for 14 percent of Ghana's mineral exports, however government revenues from mining have declined and been surpassed by income from oil and gas. The recent discovery of and focus on hydrocarbons has resulted in governance issues in the mining sector receiving less attention, leading to an 11-point performance gap between the two sectors.
"
Gabon,Oil and Gas,GAB,"Gabon's oil and gas sector scores 36 of 100 points and ranks 65th of 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Its poor performance in the index is driven by a score of 18 in value realization (ranking 87th). Gabon has oil reserves amounting to two billion barrels and gas reserves containing up to one trillion cubic feet. The oil and gas sector contributes 83 percent to total exports, making the country extremely resource-dependent. Gabon is known for its corruption in the oil and gas sector.
"
Ethiopia,Mining,ETH,"Ethiopia's gold mining sector scores 40 of 100 points and ranks 57th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). This poor performance is primarily attributable to a poor enabling environment, which ranks63rd in the index. Ethiopia has succeeded in diversifying trade, with resource exports representing three percent of total exports.Mining is less integral to Ethiopia's economy than to those of neighboring countries; however, with gold reserves totalling just under two million ounces, the sector (which is currently dominated by artisanal mining) has the potential to become a catalyst for development in this low-income country.
"
Eritrea,Mining,ERI,"Eritrea's gold mining sector scores 10 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 89th and in last position overall. Eritrea's overall failing performance in the index is driven by its score of five of 100 points in the revenue management component, where the country ranks 88th in the index. Eritrea is a low-income country with a gross domestic product per capita of USD 540. It has gold reserves of two million ounces and gold mining currently constitutes only one percent of the country's total exports.
"
Equatorial Guinea,Oil and Gas,GNQ,"Equatorial Guinea's oil and gas sector scores 22 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 85th among 89 assessments. Its overall failing performance can be attributed to the enabling environment component, which scores 17 of 100 points and ranks 79th among 89 assessments, along with an equally low score for revenue management. Equatorial Guinea has the smallest population and the highest gross domestic product per capita among countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Oil and gas constitute over 90 percent of Equatorial Guinea's exports.
"
Egypt,Oil and Gas,EGY,"Egypt's oil and gas sector scores 39 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 60th among 89 assessments and ninth among 16 assessments in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Its overall score is lowered by the sector's poor score of 30 of 100 points in the revenue management component. Egypt's oil reserves stand at just under 4 billion barrels and its gas reserves amount to 77 trillion cubic feet.Crude oil constitutes 18 percent of Egypt's total exports.The country also plays a vital role in international energy markets through the operation of the Suez Canal and the Suez-Mediterranean Pipeline. Egypt is a middle-income country and home to the largest population in the MENA region, a considerable share of the oil and gas produced is used to meet domestic energy needs.
"
Ecuador,Oil and Gas,ECU,"Ecuador's oil and gas sector scores 54 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 32nd among 89 assessments in the index and 10th among 14 assessments in the Latin America and Caribbean region. Ecuador is a middle-income country with a gross domestic product per capita of just above USD 600 and oil reserves of just over 8 billion barrels. The oil and gas sector constitutes 38 percent of the country's total exports.
"
Democratic Republic of Congo,Oil and Gas,DRC,"The Democratic Republic of Congo's (DRC) oil and gas sector scores 25 of 100 points, ranking 84th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). This result is reinforced by a failing enabling environment and lack of transparency in revenue management. In contrast to a mature mining sector, the DRC's oil and gas resources remain largely undeveloped. The country has proven oil reserves of just 180 million barrels, with significant potential to expand in light of a 2014 reserve discovery estimated at three billion barrels. Despite advances in the exploration of the oil basins, production remains marginal at 2500 barrels per day. The country has recently adopted a new hydrocarbons code and regulations that bring some improvements in transparency to the oil and gas sector.
"
Democratic Republic of Congo,Mining,DRC,"The Democratic Republic of Congo&#39;s (DRC) mining sector scores a poor 33 of 100 for overall resource governance, ranking 75th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Thesector has attracted significant investments since the adoption of a new mining code in 2002. According to the country's preliminary 2015 Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) report, the DRC ranked fifth among the world's copper-producing countries and first in Africa (ahead of Zambia), with over one million tons of copper produced. Copper exports represented over 97 percent of the extractive sector's contribution to total exports in 2015. The DRC also produces gold, cobalt and diamonds. In 2014, the mining sector constituted 26 percent of government revenues. Despite the importance of the mining sector in the DRC, governance challenges persist particularly in revenue management and the enabling environment.
"
Cuba,Oil and Gas,CUB,"Cuba's oil and gas sector scores 36 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 66th among 89 assessments and 13th within the Latin America and Caribbean region. This poor overall score is the result of failing performance in the revenue management and value realization components. Cuba has reserves of oil of 124 million barrels and gas of three trillion cubic feet. Cuba's state-led economic model gives considerable importance to its oil and gas state-owned enterprise (SOE), Uni&oacute;n Cuba-Petroleo, which could improve in transparency in order to ensure accountability.
"
Côte d'Ivoire,Oil and Gas,CIV,"C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire scores 55 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 28th among 89 assessments and sixth among 31 countries assessed in the sub-Saharan Africa region. The country's overall performance is boosted by satisfactory scores in the value realization and revenue management components. C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire has gas reserves of one trillion cubic feet and the sector constitutes just under 14 percent of the country's total exports. Significant exploration for new oil discoveries of the Ivorian coast is underway. Efforts to improve resource governance could focus on improving transparency of the licensing process, as well as bridging the gap between rules and their enforcement.
"
Congo,Oil and Gas,COG,"Congo's oil and gas sector scores 39 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 58th among 89 assessments in the index and 19th among 31 countries assessed in the sub-Saharan Africa region. The overall score is driven by a failing score of 29 of 100 in the enabling environment component. Congo has proven gas reserves of three trillion cubic feet. The oil and gas sector constituted 62 percent of the country's exports in 2014. This, combined with its extractive sector rents constituting 23 percent of gross domestic product in 2015, makes the Congo one of the most resource-dependent Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative countries.
"
Colombia,Oil and Gas,COL,"Colombia's oil and gas sector performs satisfactorily in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI) with an overall score of 71 of 100 points, ranking eighth in the overall index and third in Latin America and the Caribbean &mdash; behind regional neighbors Chile and Brazil. Colombia's oil and gas sector is a top performer in terms of revenue management. The country's hydrocarbon reserves are estimated at 2 billion barrels of oil and four trillion cubic feet of gas. Colombia is the fourth-largest oil producer in Latin America and the Caribbean and in 2015, over half of Colombia's exports consisted of hydrocarbons. According to the country's 2015 Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) report, over three quarters of the Colombian government's earnings from extractives came from the hydrocarbons sector. The government is seeking investment for further exploration in the face of depleting reserves.
"
Colombia,Mining,COL,"Colombia's mining sector scores a satisfactory 69 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 10th among 89 country assessments. The sector has been the subject of debate between the national government, which advocates for attracting investment, and environmental and social movements, concerned with local impacts and benefits. Following a longstanding internal conflict, Colombia is taking the first steps in a peace process, and achieves a satisfactory score for enabling environment. As Colombia's coal industry is slowing due to decreases in global demand, other minerals are gaining in importance. Colombia produced 27800 ounces of gold in 2015, constituting three percent of the country's total exports; this assessment focuses on gold. Other minerals produced in Colombia but not covered by the index include iron ore and nickel.
"
China,Oil and Gas,CHN,"The oil and gas sector of China, the world's most populous country, scores 55 of out 100 in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). China is the world's fifth largest petroleum producerbut despite this it barely exports any.Instead, its domestic oil and gas demand make it the world's largest importer of petroleum (tied with the U.S).The state of governance in China is weak across the governance components. Its many national oil companies not only dominate domestic production but also operate throughout the world,. However, the governance of its largest energy sector state-owned enterprise (SOE), CNPC, is equally weak. Through its SOEs, China's resource governance impacts a much larger population than just the 1 billion Chinese.
"
Chile,Mining,CHL,"Chile's copper mining sector scores 81 of 100 points and ranks second among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Chile's good enabling environment, ranking sixth, is a main driver of its good performance in the index. Chile's state-owned mining company, Codelco, is the best performer out of 74 state-owned enterprises assessed in the index. With just over 200 million metric tons, Chile hosts the world's largest copper reserves,and mining constitutes 54 percent of its total exports.
"
Chad,Oil and Gas,TCD,"Chad's oil and gas sector scores 34 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 72nd among 89 assessments in the index and 24th among 31 assessements in the sub-Saharan Africa region. Its overall low score is the result of its failing enabling environment, scoring 19 of 100 points in this area. Chad is a low-income country with a population of 14 million people. It has suffered from decades of politial instability. The Chadian economy is heavily dependent on oil &ndash; it constituted 68 percent of total exports, 86 percent of government revenues and 30 percent of gross domestic product in 2014. Licensing procedures, local impact and sovereign wealth fund governance are the biggest oil sector-specfic governance challenges for this country.
"
Canada (Alberta),Oil and Gas,CAN,"The Canadian province of Alberta's oil and gas sector scores 75 of 100 points and ranks fourth among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). This good performance is driven by Canada's enabling environment, which ranks second in the index. The country has proven oil reserves of just above 400 million barrels and gas reserves of 77 trillion cubic feet. With the oil and gas sector comprising 21 percent of its total exports, Canada has the least diversified economy of the countries in the Western Europe and North America region measured in the index.
"
Cameroon,Oil and Gas,CMR,"Cameroon's oil and gas sector achieves a weak score of 54 of 100 in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 30th among 89 assessments and seventh among 31 assessments within the sub-Saharan Africa region. This overall score is attributable to satisfactory revenue management, which is offset by a poor enabling environment. Cameroon is a mature oil producer, the oil and gas sector constituted just under half of the country's exports in 2015 and 27 percent of government revenues in 2014.
"
Cambodia,Mining,KHM,"Cambodia's gold mining sector scores 30 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 79th among 89 index assessments, 14th among 15 assessments in the Asia Pacific region and 30th among 34 mining sector assessments. Its overall poor score is driven by failing revenue management, ranking 85th for that component. Cambodia is in the very early stages of gold mining; only a handful of companies have been issued exploration and mining licenses. The government has not disclosed details of the country's gold reserves and the sector constitutes less than one percent of the country's total exports.
"
Burkina Faso,Mining,BFA,"Burkina Faso's mining sector scores 59 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 20th among 89 assessments and third in the sub-Saharan Africa region. Satisfactory performance in the value realization component contrasts with a weak score in the revenue management component, placing the sector on the cusp between weak and satisfactory performance. A low-income country with a population of 18 million, Burkina Faso is one of the world's top 20 gold producers; gold constituted 16 percent of government revenues in 2015. The mining sector constitutes over 65 percent of Burkina Faso's total exports. Burkina Faso has the potential to move in to overall satisfactory performance by addressing the weakest links in the resource sector decision chain.
"
Brazil,Oil and Gas,BRA,"Brazil's oil and gas sector scores 71 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking sixth among 89 assessments. This overall satisfactory score is driven by good performance in the revenue management component, with a score of 78 of 100 points. Furthermore, the oil and gas sector performs particularly well in subnational resource revenue sharing, ranking first place, reflecting a high degree of transparency in revenue sharing. Oil and gas sector rents constituted less than one per cent of Brazil&#39;s gross domestic product in 2015, down from over three percent in 2012.The government expected rapid economic growth after developing the giant pre-salt oil resources that were discovered a decade ago. Instead, a combination of low oil prices and corruption scandals resulting in a political crisis has led to a slowdown in Brazil's economic growth since 2015.
"
Botswana,Mining,BWA,"Botswana's diamond mining sector scores 61 of 100 points and ranks 18th of 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index. This performance is driven primarily by a strong enabling environment, where Botswana achieves a good score of 81 and ranks seventh in the index, and a satisfactory score of 61 on revenue management. The country's economy is heavily dependent on diamond mining; the sector contributes 83 percent to the country's exports.Though Botswana's diamond reserves are estimated at over 300 million carats, they are being depleted at a rate that puts the magnitude of future economic benefits from the sector in question.This makes the sustainable use of diamonds revenues crucial to Botswana's future. Unfortunately, the RGI reveals a few areas in which governance could be improved&mdash;Debswana, joint venture between the private company and the government which controls most diamond production, achieves only 29 of 100 due to failure to publicly report financial details necessary for analysts to oversee its relationship with the government.
"
Bolivia,Oil and Gas,BOL,"Bolivia's oil and gas sector scores 54 of 100 points and ranks 34th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Half of Bolivia's exportsand 30 percent of government revenues2are derived from the oil and gas sector. Oil and gas extraction in Bolivia has varied between public and private ownership over the past decade; now that the government controls the entire value chain, the degree of transparency is limited. Bolivia performs satisfactorily in most areas of the extractive decision chain, but the licensing process by the state-owned enterprise (SOE) and information and fiscal rules on budgetary process pose a risk of lost value. 
"
Bangladesh,Oil and Gas,BGD,"Bangladesh's oil and gas sector scores 36 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 67th among 89 assessments and 12th among 15 assessments in the Asia Pacific region. The country depends on its oil and gas sector to meet most of its domestic energy demands; the sector constitutes just one percent of the country's total exports. Bangladesh remains a net energy importer to meet the growing demands of its population of 161 million. In 2015, the government passed the amended Speedy Supply of Power and Energy (Special Provision) Bill, aimed at boosting hydrocarbons development and electricty generation from the country's gas reserves, which stand at seven trillion cubic feet.
"
Bahrain,Oil and Gas,BHR,"Bahrain's oil and gas sector scores 39 of 100 points, ranking 59th among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI) and 35th among 55 oil and gas sectors assessed. The country's poor performance in the index is predominantly the result of failing scores in the value realization and revenue management components. Bahrain has the smallest population in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region with just under 1 million inhabitants. It has gas reserves of three trillion cubic feet and even though the government does not disclose official oil reserve figures, they are estimated at over 600 million barrels.The sector constitutes 50 percent of the country's exports.Past political instability has rendered the government unable to implement the structural economic reforms required to offset falling oil revenues; instead the government has resorted to borrowing.
"
Azerbaijan,Oil and Gas,AZE,"Azerbaijan, a middle-income country with a population of 10 million, scores 47 of 100 points in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI), ranking 47th among 89 assessments and fifth among nine assessments in the Eurasia region. Azerbaijan achieves weak scores in the value realization and enabling environment components, and its performance is lowered further by a poor score in the revenue management component. Oil constituted nearly 90 percentof Azerbaijan's total exports in 2015 and the country depends on oil for more than half of its budget revenues, making it one of the most resource-dependent economies in the Eurasia region. The economy is not well diversified beyond hydrocarbons. Currency devaluations in recent years highlight a need for better management of extractive revenues. Azerbaijan has made some progress in transparency, but this is under threat following the government's decision to withdraw from the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in early 2017. Civic space in the country remains restricted.
"
Australia (Western),Mining,AUS,"Western Australia's iron ore mining sector scores 71 of 100 points and ranks eighth of 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). This satisfactory score places Australia at first position in Asia Pacific and eighth in the overall index. Australia has a good enabling environment, ranking third on this component. However, Western Australia's licensing, taxation and budgeting performance is weak or poor. The world's largest producer of iron ore, Australia's mineral reserves total 21 bilion metric tons and its mining sector contributes 31 percent to total exports.
"
Argentina,Oil and Gas,ARG,"Argentina's oil and gas sector scores 57 of 100 points, ranking 22nd among 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI) and ninth in the Latin America region. Its scores in all components of resource governance place it in the middle category of the index. Argentina has almost 2 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and eleven trillion cubic feet of gas reserves.In 2015, the oil and gas sector constituted just under three percent of the country's total exports. The discovery of shale gas creates new potential for Argentina's hydrocarbons sector. Argentina passed a new hydrocarbons law in 2014 aiming to attract investment, following years of policy uncertainty under export restrictions and nationalization of the largest operator in the sector.
"
Angola,Oil and Gas,AGO,"Angola's oil and gas sector scores 35 of 100 points and ranks 70th of 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). Its poor performance in the RGI is driven by enabling environment where Angola ranks 72nd with a failing score of 25. Angola has major oil reserves of just over 900 million barrelsand gas reserves of 11 trillion cubic feet.The oil and gas sector makes up 95 percentof the country's exports, and Angola is one of the most resource-dependent countries in sub-Saharan Africa. It also has the least diversified economy in the region.Distribution of economic gains from oil and gas wealth for its 25 million people is currently hindered by corruption and a failing enabling environment.
"
Algeria,Oil and Gas,DZA,"Algeria's oil and gas sector scores 33 of 100 points and ranks 73rd of 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). The poor performance of Algeria's oil and gas sector is mainly driven down by a score of 25 in revenue management. The country has oil reserves of 1200 million barrelsand gas reserves of 160 trillion cubic feet, with 94 percent of exports coming from the oil and gas sector.Algeria is one of the world's poorest countries measured by the multidimenisonal poverty index. In the last decade, the sector has failed to attract significant new investment from international oil companies and to maintain an adequate reserve replacement ratio through the development of new oil and gas fields.
"
Afghanistan,Mining,AFG,"Afghanistan's iron ore mining sector scores 34 of 100 points and ranks 71st of 89 assessments in the 2017 Resource Governance Index (RGI). It ranks seventh among nine countries assessed in the Eurasian region, outperforming Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Its poor performance is driven by failing enabling environment. The country's iron ore reserves total 111 million metric tons, but the development of the largest untapped iron ore deposit in Eurasia, the Hajigak Iron Ore project, has been delayed. Mining is reported to have represented just one percent of total exports in 2015, but significant underrepporting of some minerals, and a predominantly domestic market for others, make exact figures difficult to obtain.
